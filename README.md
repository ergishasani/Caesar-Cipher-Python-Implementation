# Caesar Cipher Python Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. It includes two files:

1. **Main.py**: This file contains the main logic for the Caesar Cipher. It prompts the user to choose between encoding or decoding a message, specifies the shift amount, and performs the encryption or decryption accordingly. It utilizes the ASCII art from the `art.py` file to display a logo at the beginning of the program.

2. **art.py**: This file contains ASCII art in the form of a logo used in the `Main.py` file to provide a visually appealing start to the program.

## How to Use:

1. Run the `Main.py` file in a Python environment.
2. Choose whether to encode or decode a message.
3. Enter the message you want to encode or decode.
4. Specify the shift amount (an integer between 0 and 25).
5. The program will display the result of the encryption or decryption.
6. You can choose to encrypt or decrypt another message or exit the program.

Enjoy encrypting and decrypting messages with the Caesar Cipher!
